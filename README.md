## Recommendations

## Caveats

`REGION` had many non-sensical values and was supplemented with a more accurate online table.
`DAYS_TO_DELIVER` had 14 records (0.01%) with negative values (i.e., delivery date before purchase date).
`COUNTRY_CODE` had 140 records (0.1%) missing; chose not to use `CURRENCY` due to inconsistencies between `CURRENCY` and `COUNTRY_CODE`.
