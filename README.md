# e-Electronics Sales Analysis

e-Electronics is an e-commerce company that sells popular electronics to customers worldwide. I performed an exploratory analysis of their core marketing data to investigate yearly sales trends, product performance, marketing channel performance, and loyalty program efficacy for presentation to cross-functional teams and drive company recommendations.

## Summary of Insights

**Yearly trends:** Between 2019 and 2022, the total revenue exceeded $28 million over 100K orders with an AOV of $260. In particular, 2020 saw the highest growth across the board along with the greatest revenue ($10.2 million) and highest AOV ($300), potentially related to increased pandemic spending. Meanwhile, 2021 saw the highest number of orders (36K).

**Seasonality:** November and December tend to see the highest growth in orders and revenue while January and February see the lowest growth, possibly related to trends in holiday spending. March 2020 saw the highest growth in the number of orders and total revenue, possibly due to pandemic purchases.

**Product performance:** The Apple AirPods Headphones were consistently the most popular product, with 48K sales for a total revenue of $7.7 million. The 27in 4K Gaming Monitor consistently brought in the most revenue for a total of $9.9 million over 23K sales. In contrast, the Bose Soundsport Headphones were consistently the least popular product, bringing a total revenue of $3.3K over 27 sales.

**Marketing channel performance:** The direct marketing channels brought in both the highest number of orders (84K) and total revenue ($23.2 million) while social media brought in both the lowest number of orders (1.3K) and total revenue ($300K).

**Loyalty program efficacy:** The loyalty program is gaining popularity, increasing from 12% of customers in 2019 to 52% in 2022. Last year, loyalty members made 1K more purchases than non-loyalty customers, spending $30 more on average and bringing in $500K more in revenue. 

## Recommendations

The team provides the following recommendations: 

- Prioritize marketing incentives on high-performing items like the Apple AirPods Headphones and 27in 4K Gaming Monitor
- Investigate the poor product performance of the Bose Soundsport Headphones and consider removing or replacing this product.
- Continue the loyalty program while monitoring yearly growth and revenue.
